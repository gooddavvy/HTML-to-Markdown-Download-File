# What is this repo/repl for?

This is a Next.js+Typescript app. You input HTML into the app, it outputs the HTML as Markdown!

## Why did this project come up?

Well, it wasn't actually *my* project. However, I got it in the coding job my dad gave me.

### How can I see this running on Replit? I saw the files "replit.nix" and ".replit".

No problem! Here is the link to this project on Replit:
